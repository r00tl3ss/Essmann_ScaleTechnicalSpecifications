                                    to sort, label and group them. Don't simplify it: Flow rate measurement
Flow rate is determined from the weight variation that occurs during a given interval. Many
operators time this interval by using a stopwatch. Besides being troublesome and error-prone,
this method does not allow precise recording of flow rates that vary from moment to moment
because the interval used to divide the weight variation (calculation time) is too long.
Alternatively, a PC can be connected to the balance to take the weighing data and perform the
calculation. This method enables measurement to be more responsive to flow rate changes by
shortening the calculation time. However, due to the syncing problems that inevitably occur
between the internal clocks of the balance and the PC, the timing at which the balance receives
the command from the PC to send the weight value and its display refresh cycle gradually go out
of alignment. In consequence, the PC intermittently produces irregular values even when the
actual flow rate is constant.

FRD
Flow rate display (FRD) for calculating flow rate with the balance itself
FR-Cal
A&D Apollo can calculate and display/output the mass flow rate (the unit of measure can be selected from g/s, g/m or
g/h), or the volume flow rate (mL/s, mL/m or mL/h) by entering the density of the material—up to 10 densities can be
saved to the device. Both the display refresh rate and calculation time (set either manually between 1 second and 1
hour or automatically according to the selected level of responsiveness to weight/flow rate variation♦) are regulated by
the same internal clock of the balance, allowing measurements to be precisely performed without the time disparity
problem described above. ♦ Patent pending

Flow rate measurement using FR-Cal as opposed to the conventional method
FR-Compare
The balance indicates whether the flow rate is maintained within the designated limits (either 3 levels or 5 levels). The
results can be output using the optional GXA-04 interface.
WinCT-FRD (freeware)
This software enables a PC to simultaneously display the weight and flow rate values transmitted from the balance on
a two axis graph so that you can see their changes in real time. The graph can be printed out using a printer or saved
as an image file, whereas the recorded data can be saved in CSV or TXT format.
Tare memory
The tare value can be saved in non-volatile memory. When this function is activated, the
power-on re-zero/tare is turned off. Therefore, even if the power supply is cut off while
performing, for example, flow rate measurement, the weight value displayed before the power
off will be displayed as the balance is turned on again.
5Data management, documentation and compliance
User access control (UAC) and key lock to prevent misusage
The balance can be password-protected in two ways: The first way is to limit the use to
authorized individuals (up to 11 including one administrator—the administrator can perform all
operations while other users are limited to measurements and calibration*6 only) by setting a
password for each user. The second way is to set a password just for the administrator and
anyone else can use the balance without entering a password but for measurements and
calibration*6 only.
Moreover, upon receiving a command to disable its keys, the balance becomes operable only by
sending commands from an external device such as a PC.
*6 The administrator can inhibit calibration also so that others can perform measurements only.
Automatic minimum weight calculation and implementation
You can enter the minimum weight into the balance by either direct key input, using the result of
QuickMin-S described earlier, or having the balance calculate the minimum weight from 10
repeated measurements of an actual, external weight (as with QuickMin-S, the tolerance can be
set to either 0.1% pursuant to USP Chapter 41 or 1%) . The stored value can always be called up to
see/change or output together with timestamp. When QuickMin-S or an external weight was
used, the calculation data is also output.
Min-S Alert
To ensure that the measured sample amount meets the
minimum weight requirement, the balance can display an
alert until the sample amount reaches the value entered as the
minimum weight.*7
*7 When g is selected as the unit of measure only
Blinking minimum weight alert
Universal Flexi Coms (UFC)
This function enables you to customize printout content and layout by editing and sending
commands (UFC setting commands) to the balance. Following the commands, the balance creates
data to be output to either a printer capable of dump printing such as the AD-8127 compact
printer or a commercially-available label printer*8 for barcode printing.
*8 A label printer that supports ZPL/ZPL II
WinCT-UFC (freeware)
With this software, you can easily edit UFC setting commands on a PC and send them to a balance/scale that has a
UFC function, such as A&D Apollo. All that is required is to select data (e.g. weighing result, date, time, ID number,
etc.), enter text and adjust the layout while checking the preview screen, which the software automatically converts
to UFC setting commands. For label printing, users can choose one of three kinds of barcodes; namely, QR code,
Data Matrix code and Code 39.
Gross/Net/Tare output
On receiving a command or with key operation, the balance can also output the gross, net, and tare values.
Statistical calculation function (SCF)
A&D Apollo can display/output statistical calculation data including the number of data, sum,
maximum, minimum, range (maximum-minimum), average, standard deviation, coefficient of
variation and relative error to facilitate the analysis of measurements.
6GLP/GMP/GCP/ISO compliant output
For documentation requirements, the balance manufacturer, model, serial number, ID number,
date + time,*9 space for signature for calibration report, calibration test report, and title & end
blocks for a series of weighing results can be output.
*9 When the AD-8127 compact printer is used, it is possible to use its clock & calendar function instead of the balance's to print date +
time. This allows you to prevent falsification of the timestamp using the password lock function on the printer side as you prefer.
Data memory
A&D Apollo has a capacity to store up to 200 weighing results + 50 calibration results (all with
timestamp), and 50 unit masses to be used in counting mode for cases when no external memory
device is available. The stored weighing results or calibration results can be output to a printer
or PC in one batch.
